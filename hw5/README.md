# CSE 373 HW5: Search Engine

### OVERVIEW
- Implement TF-IDF ranking, an algorithm for computing how relevant a query is to a document
- Implement PageRank, an algorithm for assessing the quality of a webpage based on the number of inbound links
- Implement an array heap to sort data
- Combine these features to build a search engine

### PART 1
- Implement a 4-heap using arrays (4 children per node)
- Test it using JUnit

### PART 2
- Implement TF-IDF algorithm (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) for scoring web pages against a query.

### PART 3
- Build a graph using each web page as nodes and outgoing/ingoing links as directed edges
- Implement and optimize the PageRank algorithm.
